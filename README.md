## Pitfalls to avoid
1. Go to https://threejsfundamentals.org
2. Then copy code to src/index.js
3. Find and Replace all "Three." with ""
4. Import whatever you are using. 
5. In some of the code on website, "new" keyword is missing. Put it.
6. ctrl+shift+i for opening console. and checking log if nothing is diplayed.
